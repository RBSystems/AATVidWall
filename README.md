Basic SIMPL project to control switch on and off of video walls using Sharp PNV551 displays. Displays are switched on and off using
a stepper in each case since Sharp does not seem to support a "POWER   +" serial command (i.e power on/off all displays)
tested using a 3x3 vid wall. Takes 3 minutes to start them all and 20 secs to switch them all off.
